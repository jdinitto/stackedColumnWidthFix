# stackedColumnWidthFix
Fix the column width over a series of stacked tables, within a parent element. Good for a series of tables that contain data that can't wrap, like dollar amounts, etc. No more ugly staggered columns!

Available in jQuery and vanilla js versions.

There is no requred CSS, although table cells must not have a 'white-space: nowrap' declaration, as that would force the content to stretch cells out wider.
