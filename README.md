# stackedColumnWidthFix
Fix the column width over a series of stacked tables, within a parent element. Good for a series of tables that contain data that can't wrap, like dollar amounts, etc. No more ugly staggered columns!



//must pass in the id of direct parent element of table array
//must also have <th> cells in first row
//like any good table has

//ex: setWidestCell('thisIsTheParent')
//or: setWidestCell('#thisIsTheParent');
